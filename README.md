A potentiometer controls the speed of the motors, the switch controls the direction of the motor. I wasnt able to implement the switch, but I was able to add the potentiometer. Based off the code, where it says "pinMode" it is reffering to where the pin is connected on the arduino, which is connected to the potentiometer. So when the potentiometer is moved, depending on output it will be of the potentiometer it will display, the moximum was stated from the code which was 0,255 and 1023.
